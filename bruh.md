Diego went to a shop.

He went to a ice cream shop because it was 31¬∞C outside and he really wanted a ice cream.

This is the price for the scoops.

Luckily, Diego had ‚Ç¨50 in his wallet so he can buy ice cream for his friends and family. He decided to buy 1 scoop for  each of them and one for himself.

He had 10 friends and a mom and dad. Then he sat at the table and opened Notepad.

This is what he wrote:


total scoops = 10 + 1 + 2 = 13



total cost = 13 &times; ‚Ç¨0.99 = ‚Ç¨12.87


euros owned = ‚Ç¨20 + ‚Ç¨10 &times; 2 + ‚Ç¨5 + ‚Ç¨2 &times; 2 + ‚Ç¨1


He gave the shop owner ‚Ç¨13 (‚Ç¨10 + ‚Ç¨2 + ‚Ç¨1) 

This is what else he wrote in Notepad.

change = cash - cost = 13 - 12.87 = ‚Ç¨0.13


Then he put back his laptop in his bag 
and he had fun with his friends and family.
