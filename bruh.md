Diego went to a shop.

He went to a ice cream shop because it was 31¬∞C outside and he really wanted a ice cream.

This is the price for the scoops.

Luckily, Diego had ‚Ç¨50 in his wallet so he can buy ice cream for his friends and family. He decided to buy 1 scoop for  each of them and one for himself.

He had 10 friends and a mom and dad. Then he sat at the table and opened Notepad.

This is what he wrote:

$$
\textrm{total scoops} = 10 + 1 + 2 = 13
$$

$$
\textrm{total cost} = 13 \times ‚Ç¨0.99 = ‚Ç¨12.87
$$

$$
\textrm{euros owned} = ‚Ç¨20 + ‚Ç¨10 \times 2 + ‚Ç¨5 + ‚Ç¨2 \times 2 + ‚Ç¨1
$$

He gave the shop owner ‚Ç¨13 ($‚Ç¨10 + ‚Ç¨2 + ‚Ç¨1$) 

This is what else he wrote in Notepad.
$$
\textrm{change} = \textrm{cash} - \textrm{cost} = 13 - 12.87 =‚Ç¨0.13
$$

Then he put back his laptop in his bag 
and he had fun with his friends and family.

Keep your eyes open for Part 2! :D
